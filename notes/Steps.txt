1.] Fill the files
2.] 
* terraform init

3.] Import structure

In the Google Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM Instances. Two instances named tf-instance-1 and tf-instance-2 have already been created for you.
Note: by clicking on one of the instances, you can find its Instance ID, boot disk image, and machine type. These are all necessary for writing the configurations correctly and importing them into Terraform.

3.1] First, add the module reference into the main.tf file then re-initialize Terraform.

3.2] Next, write the resource configurations in the instances.tf file to match the pre-existing instances.
Name your instances tf-instance-1 and tf-instance-2.
For the purposes of this lab, the resource configuration should be as minimal as possible. To accomplish this, you will only need to include the following additional arguments in your configuration: machine_type, boot_disk, network_interface, metadata_startup_script, and allow_stopping_for_update. For the last two arguments, use the following configuration as this will ensure you won't need to recreate it:

[
metadata_startup_script = <<-EOT
        #!/bin/bash
    EOT
allow_stopping_for_update = true
]


Once you have written the resource configurations within the module, use the terraform import command to import them into your instances module.
Apply your changes. Note that since you did not fill out all of the arguments in the entire configuration, the apply will update the instances in-place. This is fine for lab purposes, but in a production environment, you should make sure to fill out all of the arguments correctly before importing.

4.] Configure a remote backend

Create a Cloud Storage bucket resource inside the storage module. For the bucket name, use tf-bucket-897646. For the rest of the arguments, you can simply use:

location = "US"
force_destroy = true
uniform_bucket_level_access = true
Note: You can optionally add output values inside of the outputs.tf file.
Add the module reference to the main.tf file. Initialize the module and apply the changes to create the bucket using Terraform.

Configure this storage bucket as the remote backend inside the main.tf file. Be sure to use the prefix terraform/state so it can be graded successfully.

If you've written the configuration correctly, upon init, Terraform will ask whether you want to copy the existing state data to the new backend. Type yes at the prompt.

[Answer]:

4.1] add the code (in the link) to the file

# if tf is < 4.0 ver
* terraform init -upgrade

go on:
* terraform init -migrate-state

* terraform refresh
* terraform show


5.] Updated machine type and add 1 more vm (third vm)

5.1] Delete the third vm

Task 6. Use a module from the Registry

In the Terraform Registry, browse to the Network Module.
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/10.0.0

Add this module to your main.tf file. Use the following configurations:

Use version 10.0.0 (different versions might cause compatibility errors).
Name the VPC tf-vpc-826411, and use a global routing mode.
Specify 2 subnets in the us-east4 region, and name them subnet-01 and subnet-02. For the subnets arguments, you just need the Name, IP, and Region.
Use the IP 10.10.10.0/24 for subnet-01, and 10.10.20.0/24 for subnet-02.
You do not need any secondary ranges or routes associated with this VPC, so you can omit them from the configuration.
Once you've written the module configuration, initialize Terraform and run an apply to create the networks.

Next, navigate to the instances.tf file and update the configuration resources to connect tf-instance-1 to subnet-01 and tf-instance-2 to subnet-02.
